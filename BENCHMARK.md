# Benchmark Policy

Authoritative Rustwright benchmark evidence should run through Blacksmith
Testboxes using capped, sharded Docker workloads. Do not use the developer
machine's main Chrome profile, a long-lived host Chrome process, or a purely
local Docker run for durable benchmark claims.

## Synchronous trace-stack protocol

Do not run this protocol on a developer host. Reserve and identify one Testbox,
then run the microbenchmark from the synced checkout:

```bash
python tools/check_testbox_visibility.py --json
tools/run_benchmark_testbox.sh
blacksmith testbox run --id <ID> "cd <source-checkout> && python benchmarks/trace_stack_capture.py --mode steady-state --depths 8,16,24 --captures 2000 --repeats 8"
```

Collect cold samples separately. Each command measures its selected lane's
first helper operation in a fresh process as the CPU-timed sample; tracemalloc
sampling and fail-closed equivalence validation run afterward in that same
process. This is not a cold-import measurement. Do not combine these artifacts
with the warmed samples above:

```bash
blacksmith testbox run --id <ID> 'cd <source-checkout> && for case in acquisition_only/old_eager_reference/8 acquisition_only/optimized_production/8 full_production_helper/old_eager_reference/8 full_production_helper/optimized_production/8 no_capture_control/control/8; do python benchmarks/trace_stack_capture.py --mode cold-process --depths 8 --captures 1 --repeats 1 --cold-case "$case"; done'
```

Repeat that command with depths `16` and `24` and matching final path
components. Each loop iteration starts a new Python process and emits one
fresh-process-first-helper-operation sample artifact; preserve the artifacts
separately.

System evidence requires a purpose-built collector in the reserved Testbox; the
microbenchmark is not a substitute. Run paired A/B trials from the same source
revision and native build, changing only the synchronous Python stack
acquisition implementation. Alternate order by pair and retain the explicit
order. Every trial must record the source revision, native artifact identity,
Python and browser versions, command, start time, and raw samples.

The system matrix has these controls and one treatment:

- tracing off;
- tracing on with `sources=False`;
- tracing on with `sources=True`, using only APIs that do not capture a source
  stack;
- the microbenchmark `no_capture_control` lane;
- the old eager reference acquisition lane;
- tracing on with `sources=True`, invoking exactly one each of the synchronous
  `goto`, `set_content`, `evaluate`, `fill`, and `click` hooked actions per
  iteration. Assert exactly five captured stacks per completed iteration and
  report `captured stacks / (5 * completed iterations)`; retries and partial
  iterations remain visible and are never removed from the denominator.

Use a fixed page and action payload for both A and B. Report per-action and
per-iteration latency, every failure with action and pair, and all raw paired
values and confidence intervals. Identify every measured process by PID plus
process start time. Sample user+system CPU for the complete process tree over
the same interval. Read `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup` at recorded timestamps and
report time-weighted mean and peak PSS; RSS is not PSS. Retain the raw CPU/PSS
intervals so the aggregates are reproducible.

This protocol does not authorize claims about leaks, end-to-end impact, or PSS
from microbenchmark tracemalloc fields. Do not import percentages from another
machine, implementation, workload, or unpublished run.

## Default Path

Use a Blacksmith Testbox warmed from
`.github/workflows/benchmark-testbox.yml` instead of running against the host
machine. The helper accepts either the workflow filename or the full
`.github/workflows/...` path; start from the repo root:

```bash
tools/run_benchmark_testbox.sh
```

Before spending time on a full run, verify that GitHub and Blacksmith can both
see the workflow:

```bash
python tools/check_testbox_visibility.py --json
python tools/check_testbox_visibility.py --probe-warmup --json
```

Then run benchmark commands inside the prepared testbox:

```bash
blacksmith testbox run --id <ID> "TEST_DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT=8g RUSTWRIGHT_DOCKER_IMAGE=rustwright-verify-testbox BENCHMARK_FULL_ITERATIONS=1 tools/docker_test.sh bench-full --suite strict --lifecycle warm-browser --repetitions 3 --json"
```

The helper can also run a command immediately after warmup by passing `--`.
Use this for the repeatable launch-evidence path once Blacksmith Testbox
warmup and DNS/SSH reachability are working:

```bash
tools/run_benchmark_testbox.sh -- "<command to run inside the warmed testbox>"
```

For example, a strict launch-evidence run should execute the benchmark and then
write both Phase 2 and launch-claim reports from inside the Testbox:

```bash
RUSTWRIGHT_TESTBOX_DOWNLOAD_RESULTS=1 tools/run_benchmark_testbox.sh -- 'set -euo pipefail; mkdir -p .benchmark-data/results .benchmark-data/reports; timestamp="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"; BENCHMARK_FULL_ITERATIONS=10 TEST_DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT=8g RUSTWRIGHT_DOCKER_IMAGE=rustwright-verify-testbox tools/docker_test.sh bench-full --impl rustwright --impl playwright --suite strict --lifecycle warm-browser --repetitions 3 --output ".benchmark-data/results/bench-full-strict-testbox-${timestamp}.json" --json; python tools/check_benchmark_artifacts.py --source testbox --runner blacksmith-testbox --artifact rustwright-testbox-results --run-url "testbox:${HOSTNAME:-unknown}" --enforce-phase2 --enforce-launch --json'
```

If the Dockerfile, Rust sources, Python package metadata, or browser-cache setup
changed after the testbox was warmed, rebuild the image inside the testbox after
the local changes sync:

```bash
blacksmith testbox run --id <ID> "TEST_DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT=8g RUSTWRIGHT_DOCKER_IMAGE=rustwright-verify-testbox INSTALL_PUPPETEER=1 tools/docker_test.sh build ."
```

For large task suites such as Mind2Web, prefer the sharded Docker runner so each
shard gets a bounded, clean browser/container lifecycle and the run can resume
from completed shard artifacts:

```bash
blacksmith testbox run --id <ID> "RUSTWRIGHT_DOCKER_IMAGE=rustwright-verify-testbox python tools/run_mind2web_sharded.py --impl all --shard-size 25 --repetitions 1 --json"
```

Blacksmith sync follows git state and does not upload gitignored raw datasets,
manifests, or previous `.benchmark-data` results. For Mind2Web/WebVoyager, run
the download/import step inside the testbox first, or download the needed
ignored artifact into the testbox before starting the sharded benchmark.

The Testbox warmup requires this checkout to have a GitHub `origin` remote with
the workflow file available on the dispatched ref. A purely local worktree
cannot start a Testbox because Blacksmith dispatches GitHub Actions before file
sync begins.

Keep the warmup workflow parser-friendly for Blacksmith: use a plain
`runs-on: blacksmith-...` runner label, run `actions/checkout` before
`useblacksmith/begin-testbox`, and keep `useblacksmith/run-testbox` after the
Docker image setup. PR #6 updates the workflow to that shape. If `gh api` can
read the workflow/ref but `blacksmith testbox warmup ...` still returns a
GitHub contents API 404, treat that as a Blacksmith GitHub-app/repo workflow
fetch authorization issue rather than a local missing-file problem.
`tools/run_benchmark_testbox.sh` reports
`blacksmith_repo_visibility_blocked` and prints diagnostics for this case:
origin, repo, ref, workflow path, job, `BLACKSMITH_ORG`, warmup args,
Blacksmith version, `gh workflow list`, and GitHub workflow content SHA/error.
On the latest 2026-06-13 retry, GitHub could read the workflow on `main` at SHA
`b12abf5d4788a34f8b26c4f3671321dc6e322281`, Blacksmith auth was
`Skyvern-AI`, and Blacksmith CLI `0.4.41` still returned the workflow-fetch
404.
Fresh 2026-07-03 probes reproduced the same pre-dispatch 404 for `main`, PR
#6's `codex/fix-testbox-workflow-order`, and the current pushed branch even
though GitHub's contents API can read the fixed workflow on both branch refs.
`gh api orgs/Skyvern-AI/installations` shows `blacksmith-sh` is installed with
`repository_selection=selected`; the current `gh` token cannot list those
selected repositories without `read:user`, but this symptom is most consistent
with the Blacksmith GitHub App not having access to `Skyvern-AI/rustwright`.
Add the repo to the selected Blacksmith app installation, then rerun
`python tools/check_testbox_visibility.py --probe-warmup --json` before trying
the strict benchmark command.

The tracked GitHub workflow for the Testbox benchmark path is
`.github/workflows/benchmark-testbox.yml`. It warms a clean Testbox and builds
the capped Docker image; it does not by itself define the benchmark matrix.
Run the selected `bench-full`, Mind2Web, WebVoyager, or targeted hotspot command
inside the prepared Testbox with `blacksmith testbox run --id <ID> ...`.
`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` is the dispatchable PR-optional benchmark
workflow. It supports strict, equivalent, Mind2Web-sharded, and defensible-speed
workloads on a Blacksmith runner, uploads `.benchmark-data/results/`, and writes
strict-suite Phase 2 and launch-claim guardrail reports under
`.benchmark-data/reports/` through `tools/check_benchmark_artifacts.py`.
Its default dispatch runner is `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404`; when that runner
pool is unavailable, `workflow_dispatch` can set `runner_label=ubuntu-latest`
for provenance/debug runs only. Those artifacts are smoke/provenance checks
unless the saved benchmark also passes the Testbox-backed launch-evidence
checker. Local
`tools/docker_test.sh bench-full ...` runs are still useful preflights and
debugging checks, but they should be labeled local diagnostics until reproduced
through the Testbox path.

When a remote Docker host is available, use it for preflights instead of
stressing the local machine:

```bash
RUSTWRIGHT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote-host> RUSTWRIGHT_REMOTE_WORKDIR=<remote-checkout> python tools/run_remote_docker_test.py -- bench-full --suite strict --lifecycle warm-browser --repetitions 3 --json
```

Remote Docker runs are still preflight evidence for benchmark claims unless the
result is later reproduced through the Testbox path.

Some Docker Desktop hosts can hang in `docker-credential-desktop` when using
the default Docker config. Use an isolated config for remote Docker preflights
and builds:

```bash
tailscale ssh <user>@<remote-host> 'mkdir -p /tmp/rustwright-docker-config && printf "{}" > /tmp/rustwright-docker-config/config.json'
DOCKER_CONFIG=/tmp/rustwright-docker-config python tools/run_remote_docker_test.py --host <user>@<remote-host> --transport tailscale-ssh --check-only --remote-docker-check --memory-limit 7g --remote-pull-check python:3.13-slim-bookworm --remote-pull-timeout 120 --json
```

If that host still lacks a working BuildKit/buildx component, set
`RUSTWRIGHT_DOCKER_LEGACY=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` for the remote image build. The
normal Dockerfile path keeps BuildKit cache mounts for regular build velocity.

The benchmark model should be:

- one capped Docker container per implementation, repetition, and shard;
- sequential execution unless a benchmark explicitly measures contention;
- the same selected tasks/cases for every implementation;
- recorded Docker image id, memory/swap cap, CPU quota, browser executable, and
  browser version;
- failed benchmark runs reported as failures, not timing samples.

Before using a benchmark in launch-facing latency copy or progress claims, run:

```bash
python tools/check_benchmark_artifacts.py --source testbox --runner blacksmith-testbox --artifact <artifact-name> --run-url <run-url> --enforce-phase2 --enforce-launch --json
python tools/check_launch_latency_claim.py --benchmark-json .benchmark-data/results/<testbox-bench-full-strict>.json --source testbox --artifact <artifact-name> --run-url <run-url>
```

The checker is intentionally stricter than a benchmark smoke. It rejects
one-case provenance runs, local diagnostics, missing p25/median/p75 metrics,
and non-Testbox evidence even when the run is useful for CI or debugging.

## Cold-start phase latency

Use the cold-start harness to compare two Rustwright revisions. Run it on one
reserved Testbox. The matrix builds both wheels in that Testbox and installs
them in separate virtual environments inside one derived Docker image.

Run one launcher process for one sample:

```bash
RUSTWRIGHT_STARTUP_TIMING_FILE=.benchmark-data/results/startup-core.jsonl python benchmarks/startup_latency.py
```

The launcher measures import, manager creation, API startup, first Chromium
facade access, browser launch, first page creation, the blank-page probe, and
close. It prints one JSON record. A failed run prints an error record and exits
nonzero. Core JSONL is optional. The launcher still works on revisions that do
not implement `RUSTWRIGHT_STARTUP_TIMING_FILE`.

Use `--browser-path` to pass `executable_path` through the public launch API.
Otherwise, let the library read `RUSTWRIGHT_CHROMIUM`, `CHROME`, or `CHROMIUM`.
Set `RUSTWRIGHT_CDP_TRANSPORT` to select `websocket` or `pipe`. The public
launch API does not accept a transport argument. Never pass custom Chromium
arguments or `ignore_default_args` to this benchmark.

Run 30 matched pairs in balanced ABBA order. Keep the default
`per-sample-container` isolation. It starts each sample in a fresh container
with equal memory and swap caps. The `revision-block-container` mode is a
diagnostic fallback. It reuses container state and cannot pass the Testbox
evidence checker.

Warm one Testbox and run the full matrix there:

```bash
RUSTWRIGHT_TESTBOX_REF=<pushed-ref> \
RUSTWRIGHT_TESTBOX_IDLE_TIMEOUT=120 \
RUSTWRIGHT_TESTBOX_DOWNLOAD_RESULTS=1 \
tools/run_benchmark_testbox.sh -- 'set -euo pipefail; mkdir -p .benchmark-data/results .benchmark-data/reports; timestamp="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"; matrix_rc=0; TEST_DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT=8g RUSTWRIGHT_DOCKER_IMAGE=rustwright-verify-testbox python tools/run_startup_latency_matrix.py --before-rev <base-sha> --after-rev <candidate-sha> --pairs 30 --order balanced-abba --output ".benchmark-data/results/startup-latency-${timestamp}.json" --json || matrix_rc=$?; if [ "$matrix_rc" -ne 0 ] && [ "$matrix_rc" -ne 3 ]; then exit 1; fi; python tools/check_startup_latency.py ".benchmark-data/results/startup-latency-${timestamp}.json" --source testbox --runner blacksmith-testbox --run-url "testbox:${HOSTNAME:-unknown}" --min-pairs 20 --require-balanced-order --require-matched-environment --output ".benchmark-data/reports/startup-latency-${timestamp}-validation.json" --json'
```

The matrix runs sequentially at concurrency one. It records both source SHAs,
wheel and image identities, browser and runtime versions, resource caps, CPU
data, the exact command, start time, sample order, sample and metadata container
names, and the full metadata container command.
It retains failures as raw samples. Exit 0 means all samples passed. Exit 3
means the artifact is complete but retains sample failures. Exit 1 means setup
or protocol failure. The command above runs the checker after exit 0 or 3. The
checker supplies the final pipeline result.

`tools/startup_latency_stats.py` is the stdlib-only statistics source for the
matrix and checker. It reports median, p25, p75, MAD, paired median changes,
and a 95% paired bootstrap interval for each phase. The
`paired-delta-random-v1` protocol uses exactly 10,000 resamples. Its seed is
`startup-latency:<phase>:<complete-pair-count>`. It draws each sample index
from the seeded `random.Random.random()` stream. This stream is stable across
Python versions. The protocol does not use `randrange`, whose stream is not
guaranteed to remain stable. Do not report p95 from this protocol.

The checker fails closed. It requires at least 20 complete pairs, exact ABBA
balance, equal matched environments, contiguous phase endpoints, the derived
first-page total, complete provenance, success rates, and recomputed
statistics. `--source testbox` is an operator attestation. Use it only for a
real Testbox run. Supply a nonempty runner label and Testbox run reference.
Reviewers use the label and reference as part of the evidence.

Keep raw results under `.benchmark-data/results/`. Keep summaries and checker
reports under `.benchmark-data/reports/`. These paths are untracked. Do not
commit the generated artifacts.

## Local Diagnostic: Trusted Input Default

On 2026-07-03, after disabling untrusted DOM action fast paths by default, a
local non-Docker warm-browser `equivalent` suite diagnostic ran 5 iterations
against this worktree's release build and the real Python Playwright reference
at
`<reference-playwright-checkout>/.audit-playwright`.
This is not launch evidence; the host had unrelated browser and agent load.

| Implementation | Total mean | Cases | Artifact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Rustwright default trusted input | 5256.44 ms | 17 | `.benchmark-data/results/local-trusted-input-equivalent-rustwright-default-5.json` |
| Python Playwright reference | 13418.39 ms | 17 | `.benchmark-data/results/local-trusted-input-equivalent-playwright-5.json` |

Local diagnostic delta: Rustwright was 60.83% lower total mean and won 16/17
case means. The `click_button` case measured 89.61 ms for Rustwright versus
662.44 ms for Python Playwright after the fix.

The attempted local `strict` 3-iteration comparison failed before producing
timing. The Python Playwright reference returned a timeout call log for
`check_and_uncheck`, while the benchmark expected `Element is not visible`.
Treat earlier synthetic DOM fast-path claims as tainted. The removed path cannot
serve as a valid baseline. Reproduce trusted input in a capped Testbox run.

## Client Memory: Form-Fill Diagnostic

A form-fill workload — one Python script, byte-identical for both backends
except the import — recorded the **client library's** memory footprint: the
automation process's own Python + driver residency. This is the memory
Rustwright itself governs; Chromium runs as a separate, shared process, so
whole-process memory is roughly equal between the two backends. Because
Rustwright speaks CDP in-process while `playwright-python` pipes to a bundled
Node driver, the client stack is far lighter:

| Pair | playwright-python (Python + Node driver) | Rustwright (Python, no driver) | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Remote CDP, client-only (PSS peak) | 133.5 MiB | 40.6 MiB | **−69.6%** |
| Local, client share at stack peak (PSS) | 130.0 MiB | 37.8 MiB | −71.0% |

The bundled Node driver alone accounts for ~102 MiB of Playwright's client
footprint; Rustwright ships none, which is the source of the ~70% reduction
(the "70% less memory" figure in the README and banner). These are
**demo-grade, single-pair recordings** — the remote pair ran over an
uncontrolled WAN and the exact build commit was not pinned — illustrative of
the driver-free architecture, not a durable capped-CI benchmark. Durable
numbers should come from repeated, capped runs.

## Avoid Host/Main Chrome

Do not use the host's main Chrome, an existing user profile, or an already-open
browser as benchmark evidence. Those runs inherit cache state, extensions,
profile data, background tabs, browser update timing, and local machine load.
They are useful only for debugging wrapper behavior or quick smoke checks.

If a browser-engine benchmark wrapper needs a host Chrome executable for
exploration, label the result as local diagnostic evidence. Reproduce any
performance claim through the Testbox capped Docker/sharded path before
presenting it as release-facing benchmark evidence.
