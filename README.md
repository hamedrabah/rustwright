**A Rust rewrite of Playwright**, a popular browser automation library. Rustwright is interoperable with Playwright but runs on an in-process Rust CDP engine — **[2.55× faster](#benchmarks)** and **[70% less memory](BENCHMARK.md#client-memory-form-fill-diagnostic)** (no Node driver), with no Playwright automation fingerprint. Alpha; Chromium-only.

## What is Rustwright?

Rustwright is a browser automation library for Python and Node.js that keeps the Playwright API you already know but drives Chromium from a **native Rust engine** speaking raw [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) — no driver subprocess in the path.

```text
playwright-python:  your code ──pipe──► Node driver ──CDP──► Chromium
rustwright:         your code ────────── raw CDP ──────────► Chromium
```

## Quickstart

Rustwright is interoperable with Playwright — install it, change one import, and your existing code runs on the Rust engine.

**Python**

```bash
pip install rustwright
python -m rustwright install chromium
```

```diff
- from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
+ from rustwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

  with sync_playwright() as p:
      browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
      page = browser.new_page()
      page.goto("https://example.com")
      print(page.title())
      browser.close()
```

**Node.js** (experimental)

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install rustwright
```

The Node binding drives an existing Chromium/Chrome — point Rustwright at it with `RUSTWRIGHT_CHROMIUM`, `CHROME`, or `CHROMIUM`. Prefer to build from source? `git clone` the repo and run `npm install && npm run build` in `node/`.

```diff
- import { chromium } from 'playwright';
+ import { chromium } from 'rustwright';

  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  console.log(await page.title());
  await browser.close();
```

See the network-independent [`examples/quickstart.js`](examples/quickstart.js) example. After building the Node binding from source, run it from the repository root with `node examples/quickstart.js`.

Only a subset of the API surface is bridged — see [Limitations](#limitations).

**CLI** (agent-focused)

Install the native `rustwright-cli` with one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skyvern-AI/rustwright/main/install.sh | sh
```

Then drive a persistent Chromium session from your shell or an agent loop:

```bash
rustwright-cli open https://example.com
rustwright-cli snapshot          # compact page tree with @eN refs
rustwright-cli click @e1
rustwright-cli close
```

See [`cli/README.md`](cli/README.md) for the full command surface. For a Model Context Protocol
server, use the standalone [`rustwright-mcp`](mcp/) package.

## Why Rustwright?

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/assets/rustwright_vs_playwright.gif" alt="Rustwright vs playwright-python live demo" width="360" />

</div>

- **No Node driver subprocess.** `playwright-python` launches and pipes to a bundled Node driver. Rustwright's engine is native — the browser-control code runs in-process.
- **Raw CDP, in Rust.** A from-scratch async CDP client — not a wrapper around another automation library.
- **No Playwright automation fingerprint.** The driver never loads, so its signatures never appear. See [Automation detection](#automation-detection).
- **Trusted input.** Clicks and typing always use real CDP input events (`Input.dispatchMouseEvent`), not synthetic `element.click()` DOM calls.
- **Cross-origin iframes (OOPIF).** Auto-attaches out-of-process iframe targets with flattened CDP sessions and routes `frame_locator()` across origins.
- **One engine, two languages.** The same Rust core backs the Python and Node bindings.

## How it works

One Rust core — an async CDP client built on Tokio (WebSocket, with opt-in Unix-pipe transport) — talks to Chromium directly, and thin [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs) (Python) and [napi-rs](https://napi.rs) (Node) bindings expose it in-process. The two-line diagram above is the entire architecture.

Already have a Chromium/Chrome binary? Point Rustwright at it with `RUSTWRIGHT_CHROMIUM`, `CHROME`, or `CHROMIUM`.

## Browser automation for AI agents

Give an agent or shell script a browser through compact accessibility snapshots with element refs (`e1`, `e2`, …), instead of raw HTML or screenshots. Refs are session-scoped, never reused, and best-effort rather than a security boundary; snapshots include page values but mask password fields.

### MCP server — give your agent a browser

`rustwright-mcp` is a native Rust MCP server (no Python or Node runtime in the
serving path) that gives any MCP client `browser_*` tools over stdio, with
compact accessibility snapshots and inline PNG screenshots. It lives in
[`mcp/`](mcp/) and is the canonical Rustwright MCP server.

#### Install

From source (needs a Rust toolchain):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/rustwright rustwright-mcp
```

This installs the server binary as `rustwright-mcp`. An npm package (`rustwright-mcp`,
prebuilt binaries via `npx rustwright-mcp`) is on the way.

If Chrome or Chromium is already installed, point Rustwright at it with
`RUSTWRIGHT_CHROMIUM` (or `CHROME` / `CHROMIUM`). Otherwise download one with
`pip install rustwright && python -m rustwright install chromium`.

#### Fastest path

##### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add rustwright -- rustwright-mcp
```

##### Claude Desktop

Open `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows, then use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rustwright": {
      "command": "rustwright-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

##### Any MCP client

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rustwright": {
      "command": "rustwright-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

| If... | Do this |
|---|---|
| You already have Chrome/Chromium | Set `RUSTWRIGHT_CHROMIUM` (or `CHROME` / `CHROMIUM`) to its executable in the server's `env`. |
| You do not have a browser installed | `pip install rustwright && python -m rustwright install chromium` — the server finds the downloaded browser automatically. |
| Screenshots are too large to inline | Tune `RUSTWRIGHT_MCP_SCREENSHOT_MAX_BYTES`; oversized captures fall back to a temp-file path instead of inline image content. |

See [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md) for the full tool list and
configuration. Setting up via an AI agent? Tell it to fetch
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skyvern-AI/rustwright/HEAD/mcp/README.md`
and follow it.

> The earlier Python MCP server is deprecated: it stays in place until the
> native server reaches full tool parity, but new capabilities land in
> `mcp/` only.

### CLI — drive a browser from your shell

Drive one persistent Chromium session straight from the `rustwright` command, with no application code.

#### Try it in 60 seconds

```bash
pip install rustwright
python -m rustwright install chromium

rustwright open example.com
rustwright snapshot
rustwright click e1001
rustwright close
```

- `snapshot` shows refs; act by ref, then use the fresh snapshot returned after the action.
- Add `--json` for one JSON object per command when scripting.
- Use `--session NAME` for named browser sessions.

See [the agent interface guide](docs/agent-interfaces.md) for every verb, flag, and security detail.

## Remote browsers (Skyvern)

Rustwright drives browsers — but you still need somewhere to run them. Skyvern (the team behind Rustwright) offers hosted **[Browser Sessions](https://www.skyvern.com/docs/developers/features/browser-sessions)** as a paid service that funds this project.

**Features:**

- **Persistent cloud browsers** — logins, cookies, and tab state carry across runs
- **Configurable timeouts** — 5 minutes to 24 hours (60 min default)
- **Proxies in 21 countries**
- **Live view** — watch and interact with the session in the Skyvern Cloud UI

Each session returns a `browser_address` CDP endpoint that Rustwright connects to like any remote Chromium (sessions bill while open).

Use `chromium.connect_over_cdp()` for every remote Chromium connection.
`BrowserType.connect()` is not a CDP alias and does not support Playwright
`run-server` endpoints. See the [remote-browser guide](docs/REMOTE_BROWSERS.md)
for migration steps, endpoint diagnostics, security guidance, and the pinned
Open WebUI compose recipe.

**Get started:**

1. Make an account at [app.skyvern.com](https://app.skyvern.com)
2. Grab your API key from **Settings**
3. `pip install skyvern`

```python
import asyncio
from rustwright.async_api import async_playwright
from skyvern import Skyvern

async def main():
    session = await Skyvern(api_key="<SKYVERN_API_KEY>").create_browser_session()

    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(session.browser_address)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto("https://example.com")

asyncio.run(main())
```

> Remote sessions are Python-only for now — Rustwright's Node binding doesn't support `connect_over_cdp` yet (it's on the [Roadmap](#roadmap)).

## Automation detection

Because Rustwright never loads Playwright's Node driver, it never emits the automation signatures that ship with it:

- **No Playwright driver signatures** — no `__playwright__binding__` / utility-world globals, no driver bootstrap. The backend reports `playwright_driver: "none"`.
- **No `Runtime.enable` on the default path** — a normal launch + navigate never enables the CDP Runtime domain, closing the `Runtime.enable` console-serialization leak behind `isAutomatedWithCDP`. (Console/page-error/binding opt-ins still enable it lazily — detectable by design.)
- **Headless identity normalized by default** — launches with `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`, rewrites `HeadlessChrome/` → `Chrome/` in the UA and client hints, and installs a `navigator.webdriver` cleanup init script.

Local fingerprint runs — default Playwright failed webdriver/headless checks that Rustwright passed; these are local diagnostics, not a guarantee:

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| SannySoft | ✅ Clean |
| BrowserScan | ✅ Clean |
| DeviceAndBrowserInfo | ✅ Clean (after the Runtime-domain cleanup) |
| CreepJS | ⚠️ Detects headless |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Rustwright is not "undetectable."** It is not a CAPTCHA or Cloudflare bypass, and it is not fully CDP-invisible — it still uses CDP primitives (`Target.setAutoAttach`, init scripts, and lazy `Runtime.enable` for console event/pageerror event/binding opt-ins). The claim is narrow: **no Playwright-specific automation fingerprint**, plus baseline signal hygiene.

## Benchmarks

The headline numbers are local diagnostics, not yet capped-CI evidence. On speed, one dev-host run (warm browser, 5 iterations) won 16 of 17 case means:

| Run | Cases | Rustwright | playwright-python | Speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Local dev host (warm browser, 5 iterations) | 17 | 5,256 ms | 13,418 ms | **[2.55×](BENCHMARK.md#local-diagnostic-trusted-input-default)** |

Treat it as a diagnostic, not a launch claim — it is not capped-Docker/CI evidence. Methodology: [`BENCHMARK.md`](BENCHMARK.md).

On memory, a [form-fill diagnostic](BENCHMARK.md#client-memory-form-fill-diagnostic) recorded the client library's footprint at **133.5 MiB for playwright-python (Python + Node driver) versus 40.6 MiB for Rustwright (no driver) — about 70% less**; a separate [async-concurrency diagnostic](docs/async-design.md#update-high-concurrency-fixes-2026-07) measured ~66% less on the same client-stack basis. Both cover the part the library controls — Chromium-dominated whole-process memory is roughly equal — and both are demo-grade diagnostics, not capped-CI evidence.

## Alternatives

| | Rustwright | playwright-python | Puppeteer | Patchright |

| **API** | Playwright-shaped (Py + Node) | Official Python Playwright | JS/TS Puppeteer | Playwright drop-in fork |
| **Engine / transport** | Rust core, raw CDP | Python → Node driver | Node over CDP | Patched PW driver |
| **In-process engine (no driver subprocess)** | ✅ | ❌ bundled Node driver | ✅ Node is the runtime | ❌ Playwright-style driver |
| **Browsers** | Chromium only | Chromium, Firefox, WebKit | Chrome, Firefox | Chromium-based |
| **Default input** | Trusted CDP events | Browser-level | Browser / CDP | Playwright + stealth |

Rustwright's lane: **a Rust CDP engine under the Playwright API, for Chromium.**

## Limitations

See [`LIMITATIONS.md`](LIMITATIONS.md) for detail.

- **Alpha** — API shape covered; full **behavioral** parity not yet proven.
- **API coverage** — ~96% of Playwright's Python sync API (**515 of 536** methods; **411** exercised by the shared parity registry); the async API provides **488 of 536**. Full report: [`docs/PARITY.md`](docs/PARITY.md).
- **Chromium only** — Firefox and WebKit error explicitly.
- **Node bindings are early** — a subset of the surface is bridged (`launch`, `newPage`, `goto`, `click`, `fill`, `title`, `textContent`, `evaluate`, `screenshot`, `close`); contexts, routing, tracing, and locators are Python-only for now.
- **Async concurrency (Python)** — the async API wraps the sync engine via threads; recommended for **≈≤25 concurrent workflows/process**, not high fan-out.
- **OOPIF** — residual gaps in non-main-frame `JSHandle` follow-ups and drag/screenshot/bounding-box.
- **Automation detection is partial** — 3 of 4 public fingerprint targets clean in local runs (CreepJS still detects headless). **No undetectability promise.**

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Kotlin binding** — idiomatic Kotlin wrapper (Kotlin/JVM can already consume the Java FFM binding)
- [ ] Grow the new language bindings beyond the alpha subset (contexts, routing, locators)
- [x] **Rustwright MCP server** — expose browser automation as tools for MCP-compatible AI agents ([mcp/](mcp/))
- [ ] CI / Testbox-backed benchmark evidence
- [ ] Broaden the Node.js surface (contexts, routing, locators)
- [ ] Close remaining OOPIF gaps

Recently shipped:

- [x] **Language bindings (alpha)** — Go, Java, C#/.NET, Ruby, and PHP over a shared C ABI, plus a native Rust API ([`bindings/CONTRACT.md`](bindings/CONTRACT.md)); cross-language equivalence gated in CI
- [x] Python package published to PyPI
- [x] Node.js binding published to npm
- [x] Native async engine over the Tokio CDP core
- [x] OOPIF auto-attach with flattened CDP sessions
- [x] 515/515 shared parity suite green against real Playwright
- [x] `Runtime.enable` console-serialization leak closed on the default path

Firefox and WebKit are **not planned** — Rustwright is deliberately Chromium-only.

## Contributing

Rustwright is Rust + Python + Node. `cargo` builds the engine; `maturin develop --release` installs the Python package; `cd node && npm run build` builds the Node addon; the Python suite exercises the engine against real Chromium. Full Docker gate: **1,046 tests pass** (6 skipped), plus **515/515** shared parity cases run against real Playwright; CI (`test.yml`) runs a fast representative subset on every PR.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build details and the code-layout reality.

## Telemetry

Rustwright sends one `engine_launched` event per process to PostHog with the Rustwright version, operating system, and CPU architecture. It sends no URLs or page content.

Events carry a random installation ID, generated without using the hostname, username, or MAC address, stored at `~/.cache/rustwright/telemetry_id` (or the `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`/`%LOCALAPPDATA%` equivalent) so events from the same installation can be counted together. Delete the file to reset it. Events are marked personless, and GeoIP enrichment is disabled at the event level. The request, like any HTTPS request, exposes the sender's IP address to PostHog, but Rustwright does not store the IP address in the event payload.

To opt out:

```bash
export DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1   # or DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```
